# Internet of Things

## Purpose:

> Today, many people rely on automated technologies to save time and make their lives easier. One of the best examples of this is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT consists of a network of devices that are connected to each other and can share information. These devices can be anything from simple household items, like smart thermostats, to complex machines used in industries. IoT devices are equipped with sensors and software that allow them to collect and send data without needing much human involvement. For example, a heart monitor can track a person's health and send updates to doctors automatically. Similarly, a car can have sensors that alert the driver if the tire pressure is low. By using IoT, organizations can work more efficiently and provide better services to their customers. They can make smarter decisions based on the data collected from these devices. This means that businesses can improve their operations, reduce costs, and enhance the overall value they provide.
> In summary, IoT helps automate everyday tasks and decision-making processes, allowing people and organizations to focus on more important activities while technology takes care of routine monitoring and data sharing.

## Usage:

###### Education:
> The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing education by linking devices, sensors, and apps to make smart classrooms, adjust lessons for each student, reduce teachers’ paperwork, save resources, and improve safety. With tools like smart whiteboards, VR headsets, and interactive e-books, IoT makes learning more interesting and helps teachers see student progress right away. It allows lessons to match each student’s needs, helps students with special needs using tools like text-to-speech devices, and automates tasks like taking attendance and checking tests. IoT also saves energy with smart lights, air conditioning, and water systems, while keeping schools safe with ID cards, security cameras, and alarms.

###### Examples:
>> LocoRobo My Loopy – An IoT-enabled educational robot that teaches STEM and coding concepts interactively.

>>IPEVO Document Cameras – Allow teachers to present, record, and share lessons both in classrooms and online.

###### IT:

> In the IT industry, the Internet of Things (IoT) is used in manufacturing to connect machines, sensors, and other devices so they can collect and share information. This helps companies work faster, save money, and make better choices. One example from the article is predictive maintenance, where sensors are put on machines to check things like temperature, vibration, or how much the machine is used. The information from these sensors is sent to computers, which study it to know when the machine might need fixing before it breaks. This lets manufacturers repair machines early, avoid stopping work, and keep production running smoothly. Using IoT in this way makes work more efficient and helps keep machines in good condition for longer.

###### Example:

>> Predictive maintenance – Sensors on machines track temperature, vibration, and usage to know when they need fixing before breaking down.

>>Inventory tracking – RFID tags help track materials and products in real time, reducing loss and making supply management easier.

## Examples:

###### Arizona State University
###### Technology used: *Internet of Things (IoT) – Smart Sensors + Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro*

> ASU added smart sensors to their emergency blue light poles on campus. These sensors measure sunlight, temperature, air quality, and tiny particles in the air. The goal is to collect useful information to make the campus safer, more comfortable, and more environmentally friendly.
> They also partnered with Amazon to test a special device called Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro, which can connect smart devices to the internet over long distances, up to five miles without needing expensive fiber cables.

>> The data helps the university find “heat islands” (areas that get hotter than others) and plan better building and landscaping layouts.

>> Students and teachers can use this real-world data for research and class projects.

>> The network expansion lets them add more smart devices without slowing down the campus WiFi.
